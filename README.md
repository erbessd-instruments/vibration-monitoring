# Phantom data collection API example and simulator

This repository contains an example C# app to collect data from Erbessd Instruments Phantom Vibration Monitoring System. It has been tested with Visual Studio 2017 and the console app with mono on Linux x86 and arm.

The repository doesn't actually contain the Phantom SDK, just a simulator and example apps. For obtaining the SDK please contact your Erbessd Instruments distributor.

The Phantom system already includes a full featured, advanced vibration analyzer DigivibeMX which can collect Phantom data, also available is cloud hosting for your Phantom data collection. This code is only needed if you want to fully integrate the Phantom system into your existing applications.
